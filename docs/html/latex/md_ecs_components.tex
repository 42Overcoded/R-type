The Components are the data that will be used by the systems. For example, if you have a component \mbox{\hyperlink{structPosition}{Position}}, it will contain the x and y position of an entity. to see more\hypertarget{md_ecs_components_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{The components\+:}\label{md_ecs_components_autotoc_md2}
there are a lot of components\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structPosition}{Position}} \+: the position of an entity, it contains the x and y position of an entity
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structSpeed}{Speed}} \+: it contains the x and y speed of an entity (float)
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structDrawable}{Drawable}} \+: it contains a bool to know if the entity has to be drawn
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structSprite}{Sprite}} \+: it contains the sprite of an entity (sf\+::\+Sprite)
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structHealth}{Health}} \+: it contains the health of an entity (int)
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structEnemyBall}{Enemy\+Ball}} \+: the enemy ball of an entity, it contains a bool to know if the entity is an enemy ball
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structTag}{Tag}} \+: it contains a string to know the tag / the name of an entity
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structRect}{Rect}} \+: it contains the rect of an entity, you can acces the rect values with left, top, width and height used to animate the sprite for example
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structState}{State}} \+: it contains an int mostly used to know the state of an entity to know where he is in his animation
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structTexture}{Texture}} \+: it contains the texture\+Tag who is a string that will be used to know the texture of an entity, you can acces the textures by giving the texture\+Tag to an unordered\+\_\+map stocked in system class
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structControl}{Control}} \+: it contains a lot of bool to know the inputs given by the player
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structScale}{Scale}} \+: it contains the scale of an entity. (float)
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structClock}{Clock}} \+: it contains the clock and time of an entity, it\textquotesingle{}s used to know the time between two shots for example (sf\+::\+Clock) (sf\+::\+Time)
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structHitbox}{Hitbox}} \+: it contains the hitbox height and the hitbox width of an entity, it\textquotesingle{}s used to know if two entities are colliding
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structPattern}{Pattern}} \+: it contains a vector of speed, it\textquotesingle{}s used to know the pattern of an entity
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structScore}{Score}} \+: it contains the score of an entity, it\textquotesingle{}s used to know the score an enemy is worth
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structText}{Text}} \+: it contains the text of an entity, and the string associate with it (sf\+::\+Text)
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structSearchingHead}{Searching\+Head}} \+: it contains a bool to know if an enemy ball is a searching head

if you need a component not in the list, you can create it by yourself, it\textquotesingle{}s really easy, you just need to create a struct with the data that you need in the \mbox{\hyperlink{Components_8hpp_source}{ecs/\+Components\+Array/\+Components/\+Components.\+hpp}} file, after, dont forgot to register it.
