Currently, all levels we made manually are stored in the \textquotesingle{}/assets/\textquotesingle{} folder. The level name is the same as the file name. They are named as follow\+: \textquotesingle{}level1design.\+txt\textquotesingle{}, level2design.\+txt\textquotesingle{} and level3design.\+txt\textquotesingle{}.\hypertarget{md_level_as_file_autotoc_md45}{}\doxysection{Level format}\label{md_level_as_file_autotoc_md45}
Each level is a text file, each line represents an enemy or obstacle. It is composed of 4 numbers separated by a space.\hypertarget{md_level_as_file_autotoc_md46}{}\doxysubsection{Example}\label{md_level_as_file_autotoc_md46}

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{an example would be : '1 2 2000 4'}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Where 1 is an id, 2 is an id, 2000 is a position and 4 is a position. \hypertarget{md_level_as_file_autotoc_md47}{}\doxysubsubsection{Enemy / Obstacle id}\label{md_level_as_file_autotoc_md47}
The first number is the id of the enemy / obstacle, as defined in the enemy.\+json file. located in config\+Files/enemy.\+json\hypertarget{md_level_as_file_autotoc_md48}{}\doxysubsubsection{Movement pattern id}\label{md_level_as_file_autotoc_md48}
The second number is the id of the movement pattern of this entity, as defined in the movement.\+json file. located in config\+Files/movement.\+json\hypertarget{md_level_as_file_autotoc_md49}{}\doxysubsubsection{Position}\label{md_level_as_file_autotoc_md49}
The third number represent the x position of the entity thus at which point in the level it will appear. It is important to note that the x position should always be greater than 1920 which is the width of most screens. It is also recommended to order the entities by x position, in the level file, so we can easily see the order in which they will appear. //\+This is not mandatory but it is recommended.\textbackslash{}\hypertarget{md_level_as_file_autotoc_md50}{}\doxysubsubsection{Position}\label{md_level_as_file_autotoc_md50}
The fourth number is the y position of the entity, in the case of some entities for example the boss, the y position is not used. in those case we use the position y in the enemy.\+json of the corresponding entity.\hypertarget{md_level_as_file_autotoc_md51}{}\doxysection{Generated levels example}\label{md_level_as_file_autotoc_md51}

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{1 1 2000 400}
\DoxyCodeLine{2 2 2120 500}
\DoxyCodeLine{1 1 3000 400}
\DoxyCodeLine{2 2 3120 500}
\DoxyCodeLine{2 2 3400 700}
\DoxyCodeLine{2 2 3420 800}
\DoxyCodeLine{3 3 3500 200}
\DoxyCodeLine{3 3 3500 700}
\DoxyCodeLine{4 4 3600 0}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_level_as_file_autotoc_md52}{}\doxysubsection{Note}\label{md_level_as_file_autotoc_md52}
The level above would be a really simple level with really low amount of enemies. It is just an example to show how the level file should be formatted.
