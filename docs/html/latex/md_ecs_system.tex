The system is composed of generic functions who can be usefull not for a specific game but for all the games. For example, you can have a system that will move all the entities that have a \mbox{\hyperlink{structPosition}{Position}} and a \mbox{\hyperlink{structSpeed}{Speed}} component.\hypertarget{md_ecs_system_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{The systems\+:}\label{md_ecs_system_autotoc_md8}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Velocity\+\_\+system \+: it will move all the entities that have a \mbox{\hyperlink{structPosition}{Position}} and a \mbox{\hyperlink{structSpeed}{Speed}} component with a clock to have a constant speed not depending on the fps of the user
\item Draw\+\_\+system \+: it will draw all the entities that have a \mbox{\hyperlink{structDrawable}{Drawable}} component set to true
\item Position\+\_\+system \+: it will update the position of all the entities that have a \mbox{\hyperlink{structPosition}{Position}} component
\item Collision\+\_\+system \+: it will check if two entities are colliding
\item String\+\_\+system \+: it will update the string of all the entities that have a \mbox{\hyperlink{structText}{Text}} component
\item Pattern\+\_\+system \+: it will update the pattern of all the entities that have a \mbox{\hyperlink{structPattern}{Pattern}} component
\item Searching\+Head\+\_\+system \+: it will update the speed of all the entities that have a \mbox{\hyperlink{structSearchingHead}{Searching\+Head}} component to make them follow the player
\item control\+\_\+system \+: it will put the input pressed by the player in the \mbox{\hyperlink{structControl}{Control}} component by true or false
\item clock\+\_\+system \+: it will update the time of all the entities that have a \mbox{\hyperlink{structClock}{Clock}} component
\item rect\+\_\+system \+: it will update the rect of all the entities that have a \mbox{\hyperlink{structRect}{Rect}} component

if you need a system not in the list, you can create it by yourself, it\textquotesingle{}s really easy, you just need to create a function in the ecs/\+Components\+Array/\+System/\+Sfml\+System.\+hpp if its a sfml \mbox{\hyperlink{classSystem}{System}}, in Server\+System if not.
